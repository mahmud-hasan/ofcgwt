# Overview #
The OFCGWT project provides a simple to use chart widget for GWT based on Open Flash Chart 2. The library includes the needed flash insertion, update and manipulation methods for the chart widget. It also includes a POJO model for the chart elements and components that assist in the generation of the JSON to provide the correct chart data for OFC 2.x API.

The project has released a beta of version 2.x and a stable 1.3.x release - with over 12,000+ downloads !!

**Note**: A beta of v2.0 (GWT 1.6 support) does contain breaking API for those coming from the 1.X version of OFCGWT - it contains new refactored events and a new chart factory, better attach/detach support, new charts features(new Horizontal Stack Bar Chart, enhanced animations based on OFC Ichor with DZ fixes and patches).
